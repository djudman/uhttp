`Î¼http` is a wsgi library that was created for one of my pet projects and as a pet project.
Key thought - is to write as small amount of code as possible, but with required functional.
Yeah, even Flask was too big for me in that case. I just wanted to get an HTTP request, do something (app logic) and to return an reply.
